## A simple java program with particles.

It's a programme I did in my spare time. It's simple and not intended to be technically perfect.
It's more a question of reconciling myself with Java development.
There are two modes:

### First

The first is simply balls bouncing off each other while retaining their momentum.

### Second

The second lets you add gravity, but it's not completely finished. It looks more like a broken, unfinished simulation of a galaxy.
